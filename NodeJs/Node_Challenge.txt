Problem:
--------

Build a CRUD Api for Product using NodeJS / Express . Product model contains 3 fields (id, title and description) 
API endpoints:

Duration: 4 hr

POST /api/products => Create new product -done
GET /api/products => Get ALL products -done
GET /api/products/1 => Get product detail-done
PUT /api/products/1 => Update Product -done
DELETE /api/products/1 => Delete product from array -done

Note: Maintain your Product list in Array. Not looking any database integration here
Test your API using Postman
